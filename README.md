I'm an interdisciplinary professional with a background in Media Sciences and Intensive Care Nursing. Currently, I'm a Research Associate at the Department of Nursing Science, Hochschule für Gesundheit Bochum, where I'm pushing the boundaries of healthcare simulations with innovative technologies.

I'm fascinated by the potential of simulation technology to improve healthcare education, and I'm passionate about reducing the theory-practice gap in healthcare. In my work, I strive to bring together different fields and perspectives to create meaningful and effective learning experiences.

## My interests
1. Simulation technology in healthcare education
2. Interdisciplinary collaboration in healthcare
3. Research to improve nursing practice
