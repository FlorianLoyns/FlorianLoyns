I work at the intersection of healthcare, education, and media. My background spans intensive care nursing, pedagogy, and media science – today I focus on digital learning, simulation, and practical tools for nurse education.

## What I do here on GitHub
- Build small, easy-to-use learning tools (e.g. learning style tests, communication self-assessments)  
- Experiment with simulation concepts and digital training formats  
- Share ideas on how EdTech can support healthcare education

Always open to feedback, collaboration and exchange!
