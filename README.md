I'm an interdisciplinary professional with a background in Media Sciences, Pedagogy and Intensive Care Nursing. Currently, I'm a Nurse Educator, focusing on the integration of innovative technologies in healthcare education.

## About Me
I'm fascinated by the potential of simulation technology to improve healthcare education. My goal is to reduce the theory-practice gap in healthcare by integrating different fields and perspectives to create meaningful and effective learning experiences.
